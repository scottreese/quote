# Quote
Sample Node.js app which serves up a random quote using the api from http://forismatic.com/en/api/.

## Requirements
This app assumes you already have Node.js installed on your local machine. If you do not, I recommend using homebrew and nvm to get up and running quickly. The steps using homebrew and nvm are as follows:

1. `brew install nvm`
2. `nvm install 6`
3. `nvm use 6`

## Installation
1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. CD into the app directory and run `npm install` (e.g. `cd quotes && npm install`).
3. Start it up!: `DEBUG=quotes:* npm start`

## Reference
